## Algorithm

- Default to the simplest rule.

**Types of sequences**
- Arithmetic
- Geometric
- Recursive
  - Fibonacci
- Some Power series
- Factorial series
- Rotate each digit
- "cultural" / constants
  - Digits of pi, e, golden ratio, etc.
  - Primes, composites
  - collatz


New model:
- everything is a recurrence relation
- express it as 3rd degree polynomial: ax^3+bx^2+cx+d

curly braces mean they can be zipped
- closed form: `a*n^2+b*n+c`
- recurrence: `a*F(n+x)^2 + b*F(n+y) + c`
- special: `a*G(n+x)^2 + b*G(n+y) + c)`

`w * G(n+x) ^ y`
where g is a function mapping to identity, a previous term, or a special sequence
